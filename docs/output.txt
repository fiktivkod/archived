  output API
-----------------------------------

The data we handle and output needs to be taken care of. We don't want to put
any limitation for this within the core so we have designed a output API which
allows us and others to easily develop "output drivers" which handles the data
processing.

The output drivers have complete access to the configuration file to allow them
a way to get user defined input. Eg. database access information.

At this time we only provide two different output drivers. One for mysql and
one for stdout.

-- functions

output_init():

    This function is called on startup and allows the output driver to initialize
    stuff that is needed later on. Eg. loading configuration options and/or connecting
    to the database.

output_process():

    Is called every time a new event is triggered. The event is passed to the function
    and after that it is up to the driver to do some magic.

output_error():

    Converts error numbers to actual error strings. This function is used by the core
    to display error messages from the output driver.

output_exit():

    Called when the program is exiting (For whatever reason). It allows you to clean up
    your mess.
